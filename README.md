<p align="center">
  Roadmap to becoming an Industry Leading Web Developer (Frontend).
</p>
<br/>

After multiple hours of research with a number of industry professionals currently working as Web Developer in the industry, we've aggregated all the best, **free and open source** learning material that they used to become a Web Developer. 
<br/><br/>
The roadmap has been carefully and accurately broken down into a step by step action plan of theory and practice resources to make sure you never miss any aspect in your Web Development learning. 


## Things to keep in mind while going through

- The document can be read for various tables describing the content respectively. For each table, we have topics that need to be learnt, links from where it needs to be learnt alongside additional exercises/material that follows.

- The tutorials/courses that we describe are available for free and need not be bought. This document is in no way any paid promotion of the described tutorials/courses, we recommend them based on community feedback and experience. Similar applies for the links/exercises we follow.

- The tutorials/courses, being highly rated in the community are found to provide a good understanding, however, in the cases otherwise, we in no manner suggest against looking/searching for other similar videos that helps the candidate's understanding.

- The Week Structure we illustrate may not be in complete balance with the candidate's timeline. Therefore, in the cases as these, we advise to consider the stipulated time frame 1 week/topic to be more than 1 (maybe 2 weeks/topic) as we strongly advise to not break the structure of tutorials/course action.

- This roadmap assumes that you have a prior understanding of any programming language.

## Week 8

### **Pick a framework**

NOTE: For the sake of this roadmap we’ll be beginning out with React JS to set up our foundational understanding of modern day frontend javascript frameworks. This will indeed enable us to later subjectify the choice of frameworks depending on our use cases.

## Congrats!

Once you have made till here, you can jump on to working on frontend projects and start applying to frontend roles. Also, do explore different frontend frameworks now and learn about them.
<br/>
For those who wanna continue on the journey of web development and want to tackle Backend and Devops too. Stay Tuned!
