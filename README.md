# Data Science Roadmap

**Things to keep in mind while going through**

- The document can be read for various tables describing the content respectively. For each table, we have topics that need to be learned, links from where it needs to be learned alongside additional exercises/material that follows.

- The courses that we describe are available for free to audit and need not be bought. This document is in no way any paid promotion of the described courses, we recommend them based on community feedback and experience. Similar applies to the links/exercises we follow.

- The courses, being highly rated in the community are found to provide a good understanding, however, in the cases otherwise, we in no manner suggest against looking/searching for other similar videos that help the candidate's understanding.

- The Week Structure we illustrate may not be in complete balance with the candidate's timeline. Therefore, in the cases like these, we advise considering the stipulated time frame 1 week/topic to be more than 1 (maybe 2 weeks/topic) as we strongly advise to not break the structure of course action.
