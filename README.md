<p align="center">
  Roadmap to becoming an Industry Leading Data Scientist.
</p>
<br/>

After multiple hours of research with a number of industry professionals currently working as Data Scientists in Fortune 500 tech companies, we've aggregated all the best, free and open source learning material that they used to become a Data Scientist. 
<br/>
The roadmap has been carefully and accurately broken down into a step by step action plan of theory and practice resources to make sure you never miss any aspect in your Data Science learning. 

# Data Science Roadmap

**Things to keep in mind while going through**

- The courses that we describe are available for free to audit and need not be bought. This document is in no way any paid promotion of the described courses, we recommend them based on community feedback and experience. Similar applies to the links/exercises we follow.

- The Week Structure we illustrate may not be in complete balance with the candidate's timeline. Therefore, in the cases like these, we advise considering the stipulated time frame 1 week/topic to be more than 1 (maybe 2 weeks/topic) as we strongly advise to not break the structure of course action.
